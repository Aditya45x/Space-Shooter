About

Welcome to Space Shooter, a classic space arcade game built using Python and Pygame. This project was created as a part of my journey to improve my Python skills, with a focus on game development.
Space Shooter is a 2D arcade shooter where the player controls a spaceship, battling asteroids and enemies while avoiding collisions. The game includes a leaderboard system, sound effects, background animations, and other game mechanics to enhance the overall experience.
This game is a part of my learning process in Python and game development, with an emphasis on handling sprite animations, collision mechanics, and more advanced game logic.
